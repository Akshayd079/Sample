        <h2>A Blockquote</h2>
        <blockquote>
            Quotes are used to emphasize excerpts of text.
             Since users almost never read but scan we need to provide them with 
             some focus anchors to fix their attention to the most important 
             parts of our articles. Furthermore, quotes are always used for 
             testimonials and sometimes for blog comments. They can be styled 
             using graphics, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript. 
            Sometimes, creative dynamic solutions can be applied as well.
